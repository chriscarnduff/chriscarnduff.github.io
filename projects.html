      <p class="paragraph-3 valkyrie">At Valkyrie Labs, we are developing a unique imaging tool and software suite that will allow users of any experience level to generate 3D models of indoor environments. This will be an easy utility to use yet extremely modular and powerful in terms of it’s end user functionality. We believe that products sell, but tools make a lasting impact. Our mission is to develop a solution that could be used in a vast range of applications from research and education to law enforcement and search &amp; rescue.</p><a href="http://valkyrielabs.ca/" target="_blank" class="project-button valkyrie w-button">View Site</a></div>

      <p class="paragraph-3 snaptrax">Snaptrax was created at the NHacks hackathon in London Ontario. The site takes an image URL and analyze the contents of the image using artificial intelligence image processing to match it with a song. The idea came from the many memories that I can associate with specific songs. I wanted a way to match my photos with a new song. Other applications that our team had discussed if the project were to continue would include matching music with videos or presentations for commercial use. A few features that didn&#x27;t get finished include: A feed of recent photo&#x27;s that have been snaptracked by users, A means to upload and store photos from users, and A more complex and accurate matching process.

      <p class="paragraph-3 aquabicylinder">This project was created as a final project in the Systems Design Introduction to Design (SYDE 161). In this course we learned about the techniques and processes to creating an effective design to a given problem. The project was completed throughout the term. The idea was to solve a problem for a third world country that would enhance transportation, health, or resources.  Our solution was designed to reduce the negative physical health effects caused by transporting water, as well as the time spent in transport. Our solution was a design that reduced the time spent fetching water each day by women and children by 75% to allow more time for other tasks, and alleviated users from carrying heavy objects above the ground.  Throughout this project a low-fidelity, medium-fidelity, and high-fidelity prototypes were created. To justify the groups choice of final design, a final report was created which included many justifications such as; a situation of concern (SOC), Quality Function Deployment Chart (QFD), Functions-Means Chart, Morphological chart, and function breakdown analysis.</p>
